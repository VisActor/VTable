# **Submit the Issue**

Once the issue form is completed, click the "Submit new issue" button to submit your issue.

# **Follow Up on the Issue**

After submission, you can monitor the status of your issue in the repository's "Issues" tab. The project developers might ask for more information or inform you that they are addressing the issue.

# **Close the Issue**

If your problem has been resolved or your request has been fulfilled, the project developers will close the issue. You may also close the issue yourself if you believe it has been resolved or if further assistance is no longer needed.

By following these steps, you can successfully submit an issue for an open-source project on GitHub. Remember to be as detailed and clear as possible when describing your issue, as this helps project developers understand and resolve your problem more quickly.
