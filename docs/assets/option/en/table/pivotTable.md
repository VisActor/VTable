# PivotTable

Pivot table, configure the corresponding type PivotTableConstructorOptions, with specific options as follows:

{{ use: common-option-important(
    prefix = '#',
    tableType = 'pivotTable'
) }}

## records(Array)

tabular data.
Currently, it supports incoming flattened data formats, taking the sales of large supermarkets in North America as an example:

```
[
  {
    "Category": "Technology",
    "Sales": "650.5600051879883",
    "City": "Amarillo"
  },
  {
    "Category": "Technology",
    "Profit": "94.46999931335449",
    "City": "Amarillo"
  },
  {
    "Category": "Furniture",
    "Quantity": "14",
    "City": "Amarillo"
  },
  {
    "Category": "Furniture",
    "Sales": "3048.5829124450684",
    "City": "Amarillo"
  },
  {
    "Category": "Furniture",
    "Profit": "-507.70899391174316",
    "City": "Amarillo"
  },
  {
    "Category": "Office Supplies",
    "Quantity": "60",
    "City": "Anaheim"
  }
]
```

## dataConfig(IDataConfig)

Data analysis related configuration .

```
/**
 * Data processing configuration
 */
export interface IDataConfig {
  aggregationRules?: AggregationRules; //Aggregation value calculation rules according to row and column dimensions;
  sortRules?: SortRules; //Sort rules;
  filterRules?: FilterRules; //Filter rules;
  totals?: Totals; //Subtotal or total;
  /**
   * At present, mapping is not easy to use. It is not recommended to use it. It is recommended to use style first.
   */
  mappingRules?: MappingRules;
  derivedFieldRules?: DerivedFieldRules;
}
```

### aggregationRules(AggregationRules)

Find the aggregation method of indicators; the specific definition of AggregationRules is as follows:

```
export type AggregationRules = AggregationRule<AggregationType>[];

export interface AggregationRule<T extends AggregationType> {
  /** Different from field, re-create the key value for use by configuring indicators */
  indicatorKey: string;
  // You can collect the aggregate results of a single field, or collect the aggregate results of multiple fields
  field: T extends AggregationType.RECORD ? string[] | string : string;
  aggregationType: T;
  /**Formatting calculation results */
  formatFun?: (num: number) => string;
}
```

Among them, the AggregationType aggregation methods include the following 6 types, the most commonly used one is SUM. The RECORD type is mainly used internally by perspectives.

```
export enum AggregationType {
  RECORD = 'RECORD',
  SUM = 'SUM',
  MIN = 'MIN',
  MAX = 'MAX',
  AVG = 'AVG',
  COUNT = 'COUNT',
  NONE = 'NONE'
}
```

### sortRules(SortRules)

Sorting rule configuration, specifically defined as follows:

```
export type SortRules = SortRule[];
export type SortRule = SortTypeRule | SortByRule | SortByIndicatorRule | SortFuncRule;
```

The sorting rules support four methods:

1. SortTypeRule: Sorts by field, such as sorting by year in ascending order: `{"sortField": "Year", "sortType": "ASC"}`. ASC DESC sorts in ascending or descending order according to the natural order of pinyin or numbers, and NORMAL sorts according to the order in records.

```
//1. Specify the sort type
export interface SortTypeRule {
  /**Sorting dimension */
  sortField: string;
  /**Ascending or descending order ASC or DESC NORMAL*/
  sortType?: SortType;
}
```

2. SortByRule: Sorts by specifying the order of dimension members, such as sorting by region dimension values: `{"sortField": "Region", "sortBy": ["华南","华中","华北","中南","西南"]}`. ASC DESC sorts in ascending or descending order according to the order specified by sortBy, and NORMAL sorts according to the order in records.

```
//2. Sort by specifying the order of dimension members
export interface SortByRule {
  /**Sorting dimension */
  sortField: string;
  /**Sort by specifying a specific order */
  sortBy?: string[];
  /**Ascending or descending order ASC or DESC NORMAL*/
  sortType?: SortType;
}
```

3. SortByIndicatorRule: Sorts by indicator values, such as sorting by the sales amount of the office category in descending order to sort the region dimension values: `{sortField:'Region', sortByIndicator: "Sales", sortType: "DESC", query:['办公用品']}`. ASC DESC sorts in ascending or descending order according to the indicator value specified by sortBy, and NORMAL sorts according to the order in records.

```
//3. Sort by indicator values
export interface SortByIndicatorRule {
  /**Sorting dimension */
  sortField: string;
  /**Ascending or descending order ASC or DESC NORMAL*/
  sortType?: SortType;
  /**Sort by a specific indicator value */
  sortByIndicator?: string;
  /**If sorting by indicator values, another dimension member value (row or column) needs to be specified. For example, sorting by office supplies ['办公用品', '纸张'] */
  query?: string[];
}
```

4. SortFuncRule: Supports custom sorting rules through functions, such as sorting by calculated indicator values: `{"sortField": "Region", sortFunc: (a, b) => a.sales - b.sales}`. ASC DESC NORMAL all follow the sorting logic in sortFunc.

```
//4. Custom sorting function
export interface SortFuncRule {
  /**Sorting dimension */
  sortField: string;
  /**Custom sorting function */
  sortFunc?: (a: any, b: any) => number;
  /**Ascending or descending order ASC or DESC NORMAL*/
  sortType?: SortType;
}
```

### filterRules(FilterRules)

Data filtering rules, specific type definition:

```
export type FilterRules = FilterRule[];
```

Multiple filtering rules can be set, and data will be retained only if each filtering rule is met.

```
//#region filter rules
export interface FilterRule {
  filterKey?: string;
  filteredValues?: unknown[];
  filterFunc?: (row: Record<string, any>) => boolean;
}
```

### totals(Totals)

Set up totals, subtotals, and grand totals.

```
export interface Totals {
  row?: Total & {
    showGrandTotalsOnTop?: boolean;
    showSubTotalsOnTop?: boolean;
  };
  column?: Total & {
    showGrandTotalsOnLeft?: boolean;
    showSubTotalsOnLeft?: boolean;
  };
}
```

Row or column methods set summary rules respectively:

```
export interface Total {
  // Whether to display the total
  showGrandTotals: boolean;
  // Whether to display subtotals
  showSubTotals: boolean;
  // Subtotal summary dimension definition
  subTotalsDimensions?: string[];
  //Default 'total'
  grandTotalLabel?: string;
  //Default 'Subtotal'
  subTotalLabel?: string;
}
```

### derivedFieldRules(DerivedFieldRules)

Add a derived field. The vtable will generate a new field based on the rules defined by the derived field and add the new field to the data. The new field can be used as a dimension item or an indicator item.

```
export type DerivedFieldRules = DerivedFieldRule[];
```

The specific function is to generate new fields for source data, which is customized by the user. This function mainly adds a new field to each piece of data. This field can be used in other data rules, such as sort or as indicators or columns. of a certain dimension.

```
export interface DerivedFieldRule {
  fieldName?: string;
  derivedFunc?: (record: Record<string, any>) => any;
}
```

### calculatedFieldRules (CalculatedFieldRules)

Calculated fields are similar to the calculated fields in Excel pivot tables. New indicator values can be calculated through calculated fields, and they are all recalculated based on the summary results. Note: Different from derived fields.

```
export type CalculateddFieldRules = CalculateddFieldRule[];
```

```
export interface CalculatedFieldRule {
  /** Unique identifier, which can be used as the key of a new indicator and used to configure indicators to be displayed in a pivot table. */
  key: string;
  /** The indicator that the calculated field depends on, which can be the corresponding indicator field in records or not the field in data records
  * If the dependent indicator is not in records, it needs to be explicitly configured in aggregationRules, specifying the aggregation rule and indicatorKey to be used in dependIndicatorKeys. */
  dependIndicatorKeys: string[];
  /** The calculation function of the calculated field. The dependent indicator value is passed in as a parameter, and the return value is used as the value of the calculated field. */
  calculateFun?: (dependFieldsValue: any) => any;
}
```

## columnTree(Array)

** Specific configuration of IDimensionHeaderNode is as follows: **

```
export interface IDimensionHeaderNode {
  /**
   * Unique identifier of the dimension, corresponding to the field name in the dataset
   */
  dimensionKey: string | number;
  /** Dimension member value */
  value: string;
  /** The tree structure of the sub-dimensions under the member. true is generally used to display the fold and expand buttons and to perform lazy loading to obtain data.  */
  children?: (IDimensionHeaderNode|IIndicatorHeaderNode)[] | true;
  /** Collapse status Used with tree structure display. Note: only valid in rowTree */
  hierarchyState?: HierarchyState;
  /** Whether it is a virtual node. If configured to true, this dimension field will be ignored when analyzing based on records data */
  virtual?: boolean;
  /** Merge display of this dimension value across cells, default is 1. If the maximum number of header levels is 5, then the last level will merge as many cells as there are levels left. */
  levelSpan?: number;
}
```

** Specific configuration of IIndicatorHeaderNode is as follows: **

```
export interface IIndicatorHeaderNode {
  /**
   * The key value of the indicator corresponds to the field name in the dataset
   */
  indicatorKey: string | number;
  /**
   * Indicator name, such as: "Sales Amount", "example", corresponding to the value displayed in the cell. Optional, if not filled in, the value will be taken from the corresponding configuration in indicators
   */
  value?: string;
  /** Merge display of this dimension value across cells, default is 1. If the maximum number of header levels is 5, then the last level will merge as many cells as there are levels left. */
  levelSpan?: number;
}
```
