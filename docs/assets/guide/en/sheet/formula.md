- Support for cell references and range selection
- Multi-sheet references and calculations
- Formula dependency tracking and automatic recalculation
- Detection and prevention of circular references

## 2. Supported Formula Functions

VTable2 supports functions including but not limited to:

### Mathematical Functions
- SUM: Calculate sum, e.g., =SUM(A1:A10)
- AVERAGE: Calculate average, e.g., =AVERAGE(B2:B8)
- MAX/MIN: Get maximum/minimum value, e.g., =MAX(C1:C20)
- ROUND: Round to specified decimal places, e.g., =ROUND(A1, 2)
- ABS: Absolute value, e.g., =ABS(A1)

### Logical Functions
- IF: Conditional logic, e.g., =IF(A1>10, "High", "Low")
- AND/OR: Logical AND/OR, e.g., =AND(A1>5, A1<10)
- NOT: Logical NOT, e.g., =NOT(A1=0)

### Text Functions
- CONCATENATE: Text concatenation, e.g., =CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1)
- LEFT/RIGHT: Extract characters from left/right, e.g., =LEFT(A1, 3)
- LEN: Calculate text length, e.g., =LEN(A1)

### Date Functions
- TODAY: Get current date, e.g., =TODAY()
- NOW: Get current date and time, e.g., =NOW()
- YEAR/MONTH/DAY: Extract year/month/day, e.g., =YEAR(A1)

### Lookup Functions
- VLOOKUP: Vertical lookup, e.g., =VLOOKUP(A1, B1:C10, 2, FALSE)
- INDEX/MATCH: Index match, e.g., =INDEX(A1:C10, MATCH(D1, A1:A10, 0), 2)

## 3. Formula Editor

VTable2 provides a full-featured formula editor to help users efficiently input and edit formulas:

- **Smart Suggestions**: Automatically suggests available functions after typing "="
- **Auto-complete**: Displays matching functions when typing the first few letters of a function name
- **Parameter Hints**: Shows parameter descriptions and usage when entering functions
- **Error Checking**: Detects bracket matching, syntax errors, etc.
- **Range Selection**: Allows direct clicking to select cells or dragging to select ranges while entering formulas
- **Range Highlighting**: Uses color differentiation for formula range selection

## 4. Implementation Principles

VTable2's formula system is primarily implemented using the following components:

### Core Calculation Engine

VTable2 uses [HyperFormula](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula) as its core calculation engine, which is an open-source, high-performance spreadsheet formula calculation library:

- Supports most common Excel functions
- Builds dependency graphs to track reference relationships between cells
- Efficient incremental calculation, only recalculating affected cells

### Formula Management Architecture

The formula system consists of the following main components:

1. **FormulaManager**: Core management class responsible for interacting with HyperFormula, handling formula calculations and cell state management
2. **FormulaEditor**: Handles formula input and editing interface
3. **FormulaAutocomplete**: Provides intelligent function and cell reference suggestions
4. **FormulaRangeSelector**: Handles cell and range selection logic
5. **CellHighlightManager**: Manages highlighting of formula-related cells

### Formula Parsing and Calculation Process

1. User inputs a formula starting with "="
2. Formula editor parses the input content, providing function suggestions and parameter hints
3. After the formula is submitted, FormulaManager passes it to HyperFormula
4. HyperFormula parses the formula, builds a dependency graph, and performs calculations
5. Results are returned and displayed in the cell
6. When dependent cells are updated, the system automatically recalculates affected formulas (TODO)

## 5. Usage Examples

### Basic Formula Input

1. Click on a cell and type "=" to start a formula
2. Enter a function name or directly reference cells
3. Press Enter to confirm the input

Examples:
```
=SUM(A1:A10)     // Calculate the sum of A1 to A10
=A1+B1*C1        // Basic arithmetic
=IF(D1>100, "Large", "Small")  // Conditional logic
```
Manual formula input:
 <div style="width: 80%; text-align: center;">

  </div>


### Cell References and Range Selection

1. While entering a formula, clicking on other cells automatically inserts their references
2. Dragging allows selection of a range
3. Supports absolute references ($A$1) and relative references (A1)

Cell reference input and range selection:
 <div style="width: 80%; text-align: center;">
     <img src="https://lf9-dp-fe-cms-tos.byteorg.com/obj/bit-cloud/VTable/guide/formula-drag-cellRange.gif" />
  </div>

### Formula Copying (TODO)

When copying cells containing formulas, references are automatically adjusted:
- Relative references adjust according to position offset
- Absolute references remain unchanged

## 6. Advanced Features

### Multi-Sheet Support (TODO)

Support for referencing cells in other worksheets in formulas:
```
=Sheet2!A1       // Reference cell A1 in Sheet2
=SUM(Sheet3!B2:B10)  // Calculate the sum of a range in another worksheet
```

### Formula Dependency Tracking (TODO)

The system can track dependencies between formulas:
- Automatic updates: When dependent cells change, related formulas are automatically recalculated
- Circular reference detection: Automatically detects and warns about circular reference issues

### Error Handling

Supports common formula error handling:
- #DIV/0!: Division by zero error
- #VALUE!: Value type error
- #REF!: Reference error
- #NAME?: Name error
- #NUM!: Numeric error

## 7. Notes

- Formulas must start with the "=" symbol
- Function names are case-insensitive
- Supports nested functions, such as `=IF(SUM(A1:A5)>100, MAX(B1:B5), MIN(C1:C5))`
- Cell addresses use A1 format, such as A1, B2, C3, etc.
- Range references use a colon separator, such as A1:B10

**The formula capabilities are not fully complete**
**The formula linkage processing, formula and sorting, and dragging rows and columns have conflicts**
**If other cell editors are manually configured, the formula capabilities will be disabled.**
**The formula capabilities will be gradually improved in future updates.**
**Welcome to participate in the contribution of the formula capabilities.**
